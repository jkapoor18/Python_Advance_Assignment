    "**Ans:-** Python 3.8, released in October 2019, introduced several new features and improvements. Some of the key features added in Python 3.8 are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assignment Expressions (the Walrus Operator): This feature introduced the := operator, allowing assignment expressions within other expressions. It helps reduce code duplication and improves readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Positional-only Parameters: Python 3.8 introduced support for defining positional-only parameters in function signatures by using a '/' separator. This allows developers to define functions where some parameters can only be passed positionally and not by keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The f-strings \"=\" specifier: A new specifier, '=', was added to f-strings, allowing easier debugging by displaying the value and its repr() side by side.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The \"math.prod()\" function: Python 3.8 introduced a new math.prod() function in the math module, which returns the product of all the items in an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Syntax Warnings: The new -W command-line option and PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable allow developers to manage warning messages more effectively during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The \"functools.lru_cache()\" Decorator: The functools module's lru_cache() decorator provides a simple way to add memoization (caching) to function calls, reducing redundant computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Improved Performance and Optimizations: Python 3.8 included various optimizations that improved performance, such as faster callables, optimized built-in types, faster start-up times, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Other smaller enhancements: Python 3.8 also introduced some smaller enhancements, including new features in the standard library, improved debugging support, more informative error messages, and so on."
